Test program for excessive wheel delta acceleration in Parallels.

Run =Debug\WheelDelta.exe= and spin the mouse wheel. Note values.

Running in Windows 10 via Boot Camp, I get a wheel delta of +120 or
-120... maybe 240 or 360, if I spin the wheel really fast.

Running in the same copy of Windows 10 under Parallels, the wheel
delta is more like 2,500. This translates into unmanageably fast
scrolling.
